ent-NullRodBase = null rod
    .desc = { ent-BaseItem.desc }
ent-NullRodDefault = null rod
    .desc = The old classic. Does nothing special, really. Imbued with a powerful mote of divine favor, allowing it to permanently take on a new form — but only once.
ent-NullRodRosary = silvered rosary
    .desc = An expensive-looking rosary, made from silver. Exudes somewhat soothing vibes. Nice!
ent-NullRodGrail = gildgrail
    .desc = Looks so expensive, it's almost concerning. Can hold a large volume of liquid, and apparate holy water.
ent-NullRodGlove = divine grasp
    .desc = The touch of god! Or whatever you believe in, really. I don't think the gauntlet cares.
ent-NullRodBow = aureole arc
    .desc = Wrought from ornately carved synthwood, this golden-inlaid bow hums with a preternatural power.
